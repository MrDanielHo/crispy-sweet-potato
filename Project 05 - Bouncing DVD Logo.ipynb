    "#  5. Bouncing DVD Logo\n",
    "If you are of a certain age, you will remember devices called DVD players.<br>\n",
    "When not playing DVDs, they would display a diagonally travelling DVD logo that bounched off the edges of the screen.<br>\n",
    "This program simulates this colourful DVD logo by making it change direction each time it hits an edge.<br>\n",
    "We'll alos keep track of how many times a logo hits a corener of the screen.<br>\n",
    "This creates an interesting visual animation to look at, especially for the magical moment when a logo lines up perfectly with a corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot run this program from the IDE or editor because it uses the `bext` module.<br>\n",
    "Therefore it must be run from the Command Prompt or Terminal in order to display correctly.<br>\n",
    "You can find more information about the `bext` module at https://pypi.org/project/bext/."

    "## How It Works\n",
    "You may remember Cartesian coordinates from math classes in school.<br>\n",
    "In programming, the x-coordinate represents an object's horizontal position and the y-coordinate represents its vertical position, just like maths.<br>\n",
    "However, unlike in mathematics, the origin point (0,0) is in the upper-left corner of the scree, and the y-coordinate increases as you go down. The x-coordinate increases as the object moves right, just like in mathematics.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bext` module's `goto()` function works the same way: calling `bext.goto(0, 0)` places the text cursor at the top left of the terminal window.<br>\n",
    "We represent each bouncing DVD logo using a Python dictionary with the keys `'colour`, `'direction'`, `'x'`, and `'y'`.<br>\n",
    "The values for the `'x'` and `'y'` are integers representing the logo's position in the window.<br>\n",
    "Since these values get passed to `bext.goto()`, increasing them will mvoe the logo right and down, while decreasing them will move the logo left and up."
