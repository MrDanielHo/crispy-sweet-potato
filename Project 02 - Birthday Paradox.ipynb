    "The Birthday Paradox, also known as the Birthday Problem, is the surpisingly high probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people.<br>\n",
    "In a group of 70 people, there's a 99.9% chance of two people having a matching birthday.<br>\n",

    "This program performs several probability experiments to detemine the percentages for groups of different sizes.<br>\n",

    "Notice that some of the integers, like 10_000 on line 95 nad 100_000 on lines 93 and 103, have underscores.<br>\n",
    "These underscores have no special meaning, but Python allows them so that programmers can make integer values easier to read.<br>\n",
    "In other words, it's easier to read \"one hundred thousand\" from 100_000 than from 100000."
